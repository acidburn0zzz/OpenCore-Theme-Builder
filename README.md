# OpenCore-Theme-Builder
A tool to create themes from a Background image 2x the size of your screen, simple as that.
- The .png icons files comes from my favorites [Flavours Icons Set](https://github.com/chris1111/My-Simple-OC-Themes/tree/master/SSD_Icons/ZIP)
- View âž¤ [Icon Set](https://github.com/chris1111/OpenCore-Theme-Builder/blob/Master/IconSet.md)
### Contribute to this project:
- To add an Icon Set to this project, you need to Fork this repos and add your zip file containing all the .png icons for your theme and make a pull requests; this is very simple and then I will modify the curl.sh script if you have not already done
